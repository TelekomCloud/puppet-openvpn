# OpenVPN for Puppet

Puppet module for OpenVPN.

## Usage

Set up the server on a node:

    openvpn::server { 'midnight': }

For a full list of configuration options look at `manifests/server.pp`.

## Examples

2-Factor authentication with password and certificate, TCP on port `443`:

    openvpn::server { 'midnight':
      # we want to be running in 2-factor auth mode
      pamlogin => true,
      # all of these are optional...
      dev => 'tun0',
      ip => '192.168.123.32',
      port => '443',
      proto => 'tcp',
    }

## Vagrant

Look into `vagrant` folder. You can simply:

    cd vagrant
    vagrant up

    vagrant ssh puppetmaster
    # puppet master also acts as the openvpn client

    # inside puppetmaster:
    sudo -i
    cd /etc/openvpn/client
    openvpn client.conf
    # username: vagrant
    # password: vagrant


## Differences to other implementations

* `luxflux-openvpn` (https://github.com/luxflux/puppet-openvpn)[https://github.com/luxflux/puppet-openvpn]  
  `luxflux-openvpn` is a full-fledged implementation that includes key/cert-generation and handling. If you want that, I highly recommend this module. If you want to manage keys/certs differently and only let puppet install OpenVPN without taking over secrets management, then use this module instead.  
  If you have multiple VPN points you use with the same certs or want to ensure you can restore your VPN point with puppet without creating new certificates, then this is for you.


## Kudos and references

* This puppet module is partly inspired by `luxflux-openvpn`. Some pieces of code from this project were used as well.
* Thanks to Diana Bucuci for 2-factor OpenVPN!
* Thanks to everyone who contributed to OpenVPN, its components and the documentation!!
